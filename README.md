# NLP_Notebooks
A Study on Errors in Multilingual Machine Translation

In this project the following dataset was used: https://huggingface.co/datasets/GroNLP/divemt

In this repository, there are two Google Colab notebooks:
- Data_analysis_NLP.ipynb (it contains data parsing and data analysis)
- Linear-model.ipynb (it contains data parsing and the linear model)

Both notebooks can be run in Google Colab, there are no additional materials that need to be installed. All the results can be seen in the notebooks.
